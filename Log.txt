Made sure that PaintLayer works.
Placed PaintLayer in TestingCanvas.
TODO: continue creating a painting app, should be able to draw on the layer

Now I have the ability to create a model using my Layer class.
I need to create a Drawing class that takes the current active layer
and draws on it.

TODO: fix the mouse controller, the paint layer method should be somewhere
good, but I don't know where. Also I am confused as to what
objects some of the functions should have access too and how to
give it to them.

DONE: Added the paintLayer method to the View class. Now I need too develop the
Drawing class and drawline method.
